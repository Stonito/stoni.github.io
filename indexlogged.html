                        In our technology-driven world, it takes more than good ideas to be successful. Uber, for example, didn’t need to invent a new technology to build its business. The company just took3PAR DevOps Blog.jpg advantage of the explosion of smartphones and mobile applications to design a compelling customer experience and invent a new way of doing business. But this isn’t just about Uber being able to execute a good idea. It’s also about the inability of the cab industry to act quickly to transform its own business models to compete. Did they have time to respond to the market disruption that Uber represents? Absolutely. But they needed an IT infrastructure that would allow them to pivot when the inevitable disruption arrived and they didn’t have that. The lesson here is: Whether you are a Fortune 50 or 1000 company, everyone is at risk of missing a market opportunity, not securing their enterprise, and being disrupted by a new idea or business model.
